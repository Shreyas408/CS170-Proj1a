Group Members: Thien Hoang, Angela Yung, Shreyas Radhakrishna

WorkLoad:
	_ Thien Hoang: 
		+ Implement most of the rwlock.h and rwlock.cc files
		+ Set up the NACHOS environment.
	_ Angela Yung: 
		+ Implement most of synch.cc file.
		+ Fix the put bug in the orignal hashchain.cc code leading to passing the last test case.
	_ Shreyas Radhakrishna: 
		+ Implement most of synch.cc file
		+ Set Up the Git repo and the NACHOS environment.
	
	**DISCLAIMER**: The entire project is a cumulative effort. So a list of "tasks" that each member does will inevitably
	fail to account for the many hours that each member put into the projects debugging, brainstorming, gathering advice
	from the teaching staff, and pair programming.

The Design of the three tasks: ( TO DO )
    - Task 1: successfully moved files from website to our csil computers and ran it, updating hashchain to include the increment function
      and putting in semaphore code into rwlock.cc
    - Task 2: implemented the locks using the same structure of the semaphore code, making sure that we use interrupts so that it is atomic
    - Task 3: implemented the condition variable in thes ame structure as the semaphore and lock. ConditionLock parameter was used to check if current thread had
      the lock. Wait designed to release the lock and go to sleep, assuming it is called when a condition is not met. Signal is designed to dequeue one thread and
      wakes up that one thread, assuming current thread will release lock after the function call. Broadcast is designed like signal, but instead of dequeueing one
      thread it dequeues the entire queue (to signal all other threads). 

To compile the code, just call go into the threads subdirectory and call make all. In order to run the tests for semaphore lock,
run ./nachos_sem. In order to run the tests for nachos lock, run ./nachos_lock. In order to run the tests for read-write lock,
run ./nachos_rw.

The files modified/created:
	_ rwlock.h: header file for the bucket lock of the concurent hash table
	_ rwlock.cc: the 3 implementations if the bucket lock of the concurent hash table
		+ Semaphore lock: Initial value set to 1. Act like a mutex lock
		+ NACHOS lock: Lock the bucket for each access regardless of read or write
		+ Read-Write lock: 2 Condition Varaible (readCV and write CV) and 1 Lock. Allow for multiple readers access and
		  single writer access.
	_ synch.cc: the implementation of 3 different synchronization primitives:
		+ Semaphore: Allow a certain number n of threads accessing a a shared resources.
		+ Lock: Allow only 1 thread to access a shared resources.
		+ Condition: A signaling system that could couple with a Lock to signal certain processes whether a resource is ready.

Work Completed:
	_ Implementing Semaphore
	_ Implementing Lock
	_ Implementing Condition Variable
	_ Utilizing the above three to make a Thread-safe HashMap.
